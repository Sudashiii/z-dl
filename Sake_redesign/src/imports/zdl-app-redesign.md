Build a complete redesign of my app “Z-DL” with a sleek, modern, premium look. Keep all current product flows, but redesign every screen and component from scratch with a consistent design system.

App context:

Z-DL is a personal digital library app.
Core flows:
Login (basic auth to app)
Connect Z-Library account
Search books (filters: language + format)
Actions per result: “Download to device” and “Add to library queue”
Queue monitor (queued, processing, completed, failed, retries)
Library view with list/grid cards
Book detail modal/page with metadata editing
Reading progress + progress history timeline
State controls: read/unread, archived/unarchived, exclude from new
Ratings (1–5 stars)
Trash + restore + permanent delete
Design direction:

High-end productivity app aesthetic, clean and confident, no generic template look.
Visual tone: dark, elegant, technical, but warm and readable.
Strong hierarchy, refined spacing, smooth card geometry, polished states.
Avoid neon/gimmicky effects. Keep it premium and practical.
Mobile + desktop responsive layouts.
Style requirements:

Define a full token system: color, spacing, radius, shadows, typography scale.
Create component variants and states (default/hover/active/disabled/loading/error/success).
Use one cohesive icon style.
Build reusable components for:
Buttons, inputs, search bar, dropdowns, tabs, chips, badges
Sidebar, topbar, cards, tables/list rows
Modals/drawers, toast notifications, empty states, loaders
Rating control, progress bars/charts, queue status pills
Deliverables to generate:

Design system page (tokens + components + variants)
Full desktop screens:
Login
Search results
Queue monitor
Library (main)
Book detail (modal or page)
Trash view
Mobile versions of core screens
Clickable prototype for main user journey
Handoff-ready naming and auto-layout everywhere
UX expectations:

Prioritize scanability and fast actions.
Make queue + progress highly legible.
Metadata editing should feel structured and low-friction.
Use clear empty/loading/error states in every major screen.
Constraints:

Keep information architecture close to existing app behavior.
Do not remove existing capabilities; improve usability and clarity.
Keep accessibility in mind: contrast, focus states, readable type sizes.
