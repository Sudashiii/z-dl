# AGENTS.md

Workspace root: `/Users/sascha/Code/z-dl`

Project-specific agent instructions live in:
- `/Users/sascha/Code/z-dl/z-ui/AGENTS.md`

When working in the `z-ui` project, follow that file as the authoritative guide.
Major workflow/technology changes should be captured there immediately so future turns keep the right context.
Current important note: DB migrations are handled in `z-ui` (Drizzle), not `z-mg`.
Implementation plans for non-trivial `z-ui` work are mandatory in `/Users/sascha/Code/z-dl/z-ui/docs/implementation-plans/`.
